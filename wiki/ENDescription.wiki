=SecondLife Builder Helper=

Did you ever dream to easily create buildings in Second Life without needing to manually move walls, floors and stairs? Furthermore, if you don't own a land, keeping your big houses in many parts can become long and boring to always raise them.

Who needs this tool:
 * Anyone who wants to create rapidly an house skeleton
 * The professional builder who wants to offer a fast construction of the base to concentrate more on the design
 * Anyone who wants to impress with animated constructions


What can be made:
 * Houses with many floors
 * Big garden (change the walls for trees)
 * Some mazes and dungeons for those who like to play
 * High buildings with repeated floors (Babel tour)
 * Constructions that disappear by themselves


Limitations:
 * When a script that is generated with that tool contains approximately more than 180 lines, Second Life risks to give you an error when the script will be saved.
  * That is why this tool is optimizing the generated script to make loops with redundant code
  * If this situation happens to you, you simply need to put your scene in many parts like one floor at a time
  * Seriously, it is rare that this happens for normal buildings. It is more with big maze that it happens.
 * If there are too much moves made (llSetPos), during the execution of the script, Second Life will ignore those calls after a big amount has been processed
  * This is really rare too since this tool tends to minimize the moves
